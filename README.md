# Would You Rather Project

This repository contains my implementation of the project "Would you rather" game (Redux assessment project for the [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)).

This project is an implementation of the game "would you rather" where the users will select if they would rather option A or option B of the question asked. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they havenâ€™t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Getting started

### Step 1:
Check out the project's "master" branch and install the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) .

### Step 2:

After successfully finish the installation, cd into your project directory and run the command "npm install" if you installed Node or "yarn start" if you chosen Yarn. This will take a while for your first install as it will download all the project dependencies.

```
cd /game-would-you-rather
$ npm install
```

```
cd /game-would-you-rather
$ yarn install
```

### Step 3:
When the installation of the dependencies has finished, you should be able to do:

```
$ npm start
```

or

```
$ yarn start
```

This will start the local server for development and the project will be now running on: `http://localhost:3000/`
